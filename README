=========================================================================
1. Introduction
=========================================================================
This is a fork of libLBFGS, restructured to be a header-only library.

libLBFGS is a C port of the implementation of Limited-memory
Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) method written by Jorge Nocedal.
The original FORTRAN source code is available at:
http://www.ece.northwestern.edu/~nocedal/lbfgs.html

The L-BFGS method solves the unconstrainted minimization problem:
    minimize F(x), x = (x1, x2, ..., xN),
only if the objective function F(x) and its gradient G(x) are computable.

Refer to the libLBFGS web site for more information.

2. How to build
=========================================================================
No build. Just drop lbfgs*.h into your project and #include them. 
In exactly one C file, you need to define LBFGS_IMPLEMENTATION before
you #include "lbfgs.h"


=========================================================================
3. Note on SSE/SSE2 optimization
=========================================================================
This library has SSE/SSE2 optimization routines for vector arithmetic
operations on Intel/AMD processors. The SSE2 routine is for 64 bit double
values, and the SSE routine is for 32 bit float values. Since the default
parameters in libLBFGS are tuned for double precision values, it may need
to modify these parameters to use the SSE optimization routines.

To use the SSE2 optimization routine, #define USE_SSE in the same place
you #define LBFGS_IMPLEMENTATION


=========================================================================
4. Note on floating point precision
=========================================================================
This library uses double precision by default. If you want single,
`#define LBFGS_FLOAT 32` before you include "lbfgs.h" (everywhere).
